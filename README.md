# Solutions for Advent of Code 2025

Having just discovered Advent of Code, I decided to have a go at solving the
puzzles on the day. This repository will contain the solutions I wrote to
solve the puzzle.

Go check out Advent of Code 2025 at <https://adventofcode.com/2025>.

## Why solve in C?

With limitation comes creativity. While I'm sure all the standard library
features I'm missing in C++ will be better implemented than anything I will
write for my solutions, not having access to those means that I will have to
look for other solutions if I don't want to implement those standard library
features myself. It also makes me look into how those features are implemented
so that I could also try to implement something similar.

Plus, I like the challenge.

## Building the Solutions

The included [Makefile](./Makefile) contains all the commands needed to compile
the solutions.

**Note**: These solutions are written using the C23 standard. You should use a
compiler which supports that. These are currently known to work on GCC 15 on
Linux.
